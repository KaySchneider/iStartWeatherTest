iStartWeatherTest
=================

This is a small angular.js chrome packaded application test.

The angular code isnt best practice because this is my first application 
on top of angular.js ;)


An small chrome packaged app wich displays the weather from weatherunderground.com  example inspired by an tutorial from "ng-newsletter.com"
